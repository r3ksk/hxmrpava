## Introduction
The SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting solution gives talent acquisition teams the tools, insights, and time they need to deliver winning experiences for each candidate with every interaction. A certain process like prescreening questions and offer letter distribution is manual and needs to be set up individually on each job requisition or job application. This adds more time to recruiting or attracting top talent to the customer’s organization. Every customer leverages the above two steps and can define what are the reproducible steps on how to default them.

Using Business Rules, Custom Fields, and MDF (Meta Data Framework) tables powered by SAP Process Automation (SPA), these tasks can be automated in near real-time, which increases the job satisfaction of the talent acquisition teams and helps the customer organizations to advertise jobs and provide candidates offer letters quicker.

A simpler and faster way to enhance business efficiency and agility with confidence using SAP Process Automation.
